                <h4> Sell me on the iphone </h4>
                <p> I have an android right now and i love the thing to death. I have encountered zero problems with it. I had an iphone once and hated it. But it was the 4 or 4s. All of my friends have iphones and they live in a different state so I know getting an iphone would make it easier for us to communicate. The only problem I have with the iphones are that every time I get new music I have to resynce my whole phone just to add a couple songs or albums. With photos I had to use the photos app and again sync my phone in order to get them off the phone. With Android all I have to do is click and drag both my photos and music and in less than 30 seconds I am done. So r/apple sell on why I should get an ihpone </p>

                        You may be happier with Android, but if you want to be convinced, I will bring up these points:

                        The iPhone 7 is ridiculously faster than I’m pretty sure all Android phones, or at least all the industry leaders. It’s a year old, and still crushes the brand new Galaxy Note 8 in everyday Speed Tests.
                        
                        Also, there are a wider and better variety of apps. This may not seem too important, since the Play Store has millions as well, but if you’re looking for something that suits your needs, a wider variety of apps means you’re more likely to find an app that’s best for you.
                        
                        iMessage is also a bigger one than it may seem. It’s just every way nicer than SMS, and unlike Facebook messenger or other alternatives, it’s seamless with all your SMS conversations.
                        
                        You may not care about this one, but it’s more secure. A lot more secure. A lot a lot. And much more private. It even has activation lock, which will deter theft, since a stolen iPhone is useless except as scrap.
                        
                        There will be no bloatware from the manufacturer nor carrier. You can delete most of the non-essential Stock apps. If you buy it unlocked, it will stay unlocked when an SIM is inserted.
                        
                        3D Touch is a cool feature that I’m surprised hasn’t been copied yet. It can be confusing where it exists, but useful none the less.
                        
                        AR apps are coming in iOS 11, and they are awesome. Some are just simple show off things, but others are actually useful. Check out the website above for a good demo.
                        
                        You will almost definitely miss the customizability of Android, and a lot of things I can’t think of, so after the 14-days if you don’t like it, return it.
                        
                        Here’s an Android user’s thoughts on the last iPhone. Most of it still pertains to the iPhone 7, so give it a watch.
                        
                        Also, a new iPhone is being announced on the 12th, so you may want to either get that one, or wait until the price drops on the current one
